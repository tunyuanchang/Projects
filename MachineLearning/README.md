## Dengue Case Prediction
###### Regression
* Implement "Gradient Descent" for linear regression from scratch.
* Build the model to predict the number of dengue cases of three cities with self-built regression model. (Regression)

## Diabetes Prediction
###### Classification
* Implement "Decision Tree" and "Random Forest" for classification from scratch.
* Build the model to predict whether the patients have diabetes or not with self-built random forest classifier. (Binary classification)
* Adopt the methods of undersampling for imbalanced data and fisher score for feature selection to improve performance of model.

## Neural Network
###### Neural Network
* Implement "Neural Network" (including Dense layer and Activation layer[Sigmoid, Softmax, ReLU function]) from scratch.
* Build the model with optimization algorithm of batch gradient to determine whether breast cancer is malignant or benign with self-built neural network. (Binary classification)
* Build the model with optimization algorithm of mini-batch gradient to classify MNIST handwritten digits with self-built neural network. (Multi-class classification)
  
## Convolutional Neural Network
###### Convolutional Neural Network
* Implemnt "Convolutional Neural Network" (including Convolution layer and Maxpooling layer) from scratch on the basis of Neural Network above.
