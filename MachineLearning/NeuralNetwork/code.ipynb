For the special case, K = 4, we have <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/554/1*SWfgFQLDIPXDf1C6CHmr8A.png\" height=\"100\"/>. <br> It is quite complicated to calculate the softmax derivative on its own. However, if you use the softmax and the cross entropy loss, that complexity fades away. Since the softmax layer is usually used at the output, we can actually calculate the derivative of the categorical cross-entropy loss with respect to the n-th node in the last hidden layer. Instead of a long clunky formula, you end up with this terse, easy to compute thing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial Z_i} = s_i - y_i $$, where $s$ is the output of the softmax function and the $y$ is the true label vector(one-hot vector). For more information, you can refer to this article [Derivative of the Softmax Function and the Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/derivative-of-the-softmax-function-and-the-categorical-cross-entropy-loss-ffceefc081d1). <br> \n","❗**Important**❗: The above mathematical derivation is based on naive implementation. In order to deal with the exponential overflow problem, we should use the normalized exponential function when counting $s$.

multi-class classifier using the functions you had previously written. You will create a model that can classify ten handwritten digits. The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset in computer vision and deep learning. We usually use convolutional deep-learning neural networks for image classification. However, using only dense layers appears to be enough to handle this simple dataset, and this is a good way to get started with image datasets. \n","\n","**Exercise**: Implement a multi-class classifier and tune hyperparameter. (15%)\n","\n","**Instruction**:\n","*   Use the functions you had previously written.\n","*   Preprocess the data to match the correct input format.\n","*   Use mini-batch gradient descent to train the model.\n","\n","**Hint**:\n","For data preprocessing, please be careful with the dimension of the inputs (X and y) and also note that the values of images are usually integers that fall between 0 and 255. You need to change the data type into float and scale the values between 0 and 1.\n","\n","In Batch Gradient Descent, we consider all the samples for every step of Gradient Descent. But what if our dataset is huge? MNIST training data contains 60000 training samples, then to take one step, the model will have to calculate the gradients of all the 60000 samples. This does not seem an efficient way. Hence, mini-batch gradient descent is recommended to be used in this
