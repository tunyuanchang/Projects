## Frequent Patterns
* Implenment “FP-Growth” from scratch to find freqent patterns with support in transactions.
  
## Machine Learning
**Supervised Binary Classification Problem with Machine Learning**
* Implenment random forest classifier with feature engineering.
* Including categorical encoding, date and time engineering, outlier engineering and missing data imputation.
* Adopt the methods of oversampling for imbalanced data to improve performance of model.
  
## Graph Neural Network
**Node Classification**
* Implement GNN for node classification on PubMed dataset.
* Test the learning ability of graph neural network with lack of labeled data. (Take structural information into account.)

## Horizontal Federated Learning
**Image Classification**
* Implement both server and user base for horizontal federated learning with FedAvg algorithms on CIFAR10 dataset.
* Discussion:
  * data distribution v.s. global model accuracy
  * number of users in a round v.s. global model accuracy and global model convergence speed

## Graph Adversarial Attack
**Node Misclassification**
* Implement Nettack algorithms for graph adversarial attack on Cora citation network dataset.
